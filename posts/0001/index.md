# Boom City - A Year In Review 
---
Halloween 2024 I respond to a Craigslist ad for a construction laborer opening. Roughly a week later, I'm 
the newest employee at Boom City Builders - a local residential contractor owned and opertated by Bay native Garritt Blanz.

For the last year and half, I've worked as Garritt's right-hand man on a number of projects around the City. A majority of my time 
has been spent at Garritt's home in Bernal Heights where we're in the process of an ambitious remodel. 

This post is intended to catalog images and stories from 2025's many sites.

# York

Throughout the year I spent more than a few days at York. Mold investigations, fence and deck upgrades, 
a full roof replacement. I've had the privelege of working on a number of beautiful San Franciscan homes, 
1306 York St stands apart from the rest.

# Fence Upgrade 
---
Cedar is a recurring theme at York. This fence repair/upgrade was a solo project. Garritt sourced 
the stack of high quality one-bys; I laid out, cut, and installed boards to extend the left side of the 
fence and fill the awkward corner gap where the perimeter meets the house. 

I love repetitive finish work like this. After the first few cuts, I slip into a flow state - 
each board is perfectly sized, every screw layout uniform and square. Days like this are a treat.
