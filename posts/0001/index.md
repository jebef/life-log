# Boom City - A Year In Review 
---

Halloween 2024 I respond to a Craigslist ad for a construction laborer opening. Roughly a week later, I'm 
the newest employee at Boom City Builders - a local residential contractor owned and opertated by Bay native Garritt Blanz.

For the last year and half, I've worked as Garritt's right-hand man on a number of projects around the City. A majority of my time 
has been spent at Garritt's home in Bernal Heights where we're in the process of an ambitious remodel. 

This post is intended to catalog images and stories from 2025's many sites.
